<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q3" name=3DQ3><B>Q3</A>. =
I'm trying=20
to make a layout larger. How?</B>=20
<P>There are various ways to increase the size of a layout. In doing =
this, one=20
has to decide if the sizes of the nodes and text should be increased as =
well.=20
<P>One approach is to adjust individual parameters such as <TT>fontsize, =

nodesep</TT> and <TT>ranksep</TT>. For example, <PRE>           digraph =
G {
                graph [fontsize=3D24];
                edge  [fontsize=3D24];
                node  [fontsize=3D24];
                ranksep =3D 1.5;
                nodesep =3D .25;
                edge [style=3D"setlinewidth(3)"];
                a -&gt; b -&gt; c;
           }
</PRE>If you do this, make sure you are not fighting a conflicting graph =
size=20
setting, like <TT>size=3D"6,6"</TT>, which will then scale everything =
back down.=20
<P>If you are using fdp or neato, increasing the edge len will tend to =
expand=20
the layout. <PRE>        graph G {
           edge [len=3D3]
           a -- { b c d }
        }
</PRE>For twopi and circo, there are other parameters such as =
<TT>ranksep</TT>=20
which can be used. See the <A=20
href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html">graph attributes</A>.=20
<P>You can also use the <TT>ratio</TT> attribute. If you set the =
<TT>size</TT>=20
attribute to the desired drawing size, and then set =
<TT>ratio=3Dfill</TT>, node=20
positions are scaled separately in x and y until the drawing fills the =
specified=20
<TT>size</TT>. Note that node sizes stay the same. If, instead, you set=20
<TT>ratio=3Dexpand</TT>, the layout is uniformly scaled up in x and y =
until at=20
least one dimension fits <TT>size</TT>.=20
<P>If you specify the <TT>size</TT> attribute but end it with an =
exclamation=20
mark (!), the final drawing will be scaled up uniformly in x and y until =
at=20
least one dimension fits <TT>size</TT>. Note that everything is scaled =
up,=20
including text and node sizes.=20
<P>If you're using Postscript, you can just scale up the output by =
manually=20
adding a command such as <TT>2 2 scale</TT> where the Postscript =
environment is=20
set up. Make sure to adjust the <TT>BoundingBox</TT> too if your tools =
look at=20
this header.=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q4" name=3DQ4><B>Q4</A>. =
How can I=20
join or merge certain edge routes in dot?</B>=20
<P>You can try running <TT>dot -Gconcentrate=3Dtrue</TT> or you can =
introduce your=20
own virtual nodes drawn as tiny circles where you want to split or join =
edges: <PRE>digraph G {
  yourvirtualnode [shape=3Dcircle,width=3D.01,height=3D.01,label=3D""];
  a -&gt; yourvirtualnode [arrowhead=3Dnone]
  yourvirtualnode -&gt; {b;c}
}
</PRE>
<P><A name=3DQ4a><B>Q. How can I generate graph layouts in PDF?</B> </A>
<P>First, create Postscript output, then use an external converter from=20
Postscript to PDF. For example,<BR><TT>dot -Tps | epsf2pdf -o=20
file.pdf</TT><BR>Note that URL tags are respected, to allow clickable =
PDF=20
objects.=20
<P>If your intention is to use the figure as PDF in some document =
preparation=20
system, such as pdflatex, it is very important to use -Tps2 rather than =
-Tps. In=20
general, if you really want PDF output, that is, you would like to have =
a -Tpdf=20
flag, use -Tps2 before converting to PDF.=20
<P>In the diagram below, the shaded nodes will contain bad =
output.<BR><IMG=20
src=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/pspdf.png">=20
<P><A name=3DQ4b><B>Q. How can I make duplicate nodes?</B> </A>
<P>Make unique nodes with duplicate labels. <PRE>      digraph G {
            node001 [label =3D "A"];
            node002 [label =3D "A"];
			node001 -&gt; node002;
	  }
</PRE>
<P><A name=3DQ4c><B>Q. How can I set a graph or cluster label without =
its=20
propagating to all sub-clusters?</B> </A>
<P>Set the label at the end of the graph (before the closing brace), =
after all=20
its contents have been defined. (We admit it seems desirable to define =
some=20
special syntax for non-inherited attribute settings.)=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q5" name=3DQ5><B>Q5</A>. =
How can I=20
draw multiple parallel edges in neato?</B>=20
<P>This is possible when the <TT>splines</TT> attribute is false, which =
is the=20
default. When <TT>splines=3Dtrue</TT>, we have no good answer but we are =
working=20
on it. One trick which is sometimes sufficient is to specify multiple =
colors for=20
the edge. This will a produce set of tightly parallel splines, each in =
its=20
specified color. Read about the <A=20
href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:color">color =
attribute</A> for=20
more information.=20
<H2>Clusters</H2><A name=3DQ5a><B>Q. How can I create edges between =
cluster=20
boxes?</B> </A>
<P>This only works in Graphviz version 1.7 and higher. To make edges =
between=20
clusters, first set the graph attribute <TT>compound=3Dtrue</TT>. Then, =
you can=20
specify a cluster by name as a <I>logical head or tail</I> to an edge. =
This will=20
cause the edge joining the two nodes to be clipped to the exterior of =
the box=20
around the given cluster.=20
<P>For example, <PRE>      digraph G {
        compound=3Dtrue;
        nodesep=3D1.0;
        subgraph cluster_A {
          a -&gt; b;
          a -&gt; c;
        }
        subgraph cluster_B {
          d -&gt; e;
          f -&gt; e;
        }
        a -&gt; e [ ltail=3Dcluster_A,
                 lhead=3Dcluster_B ];
      }
</PRE>has an edge going from <TT>cluster_A</TT> to <TT>cluster_B</TT>. =
If,=20
instead, you say <PRE>        a -&gt; e [ltail=3Dcluster_A];
</PRE>this gives you an edge from <TT>cluster_A</TT> to node <TT>e</TT>. =
Or you=20
could just specify an <TT>lhead</TT> attribute. The program warns if a =
cluster=20
specified as a logical node is not defined. Also, if a cluster is =
specified as a=20
logical head for an edge, the real head must be contained in the =
cluster, and=20
the real tail must not be. A similar check is done for logical tails. In =
these=20
cases, the edge is drawn between the real nodes as usual.=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q6" name=3DQ6><B>Q6</A>. =
Clusters are=20
hard to see.</B>=20
<P>Set <TT>bgcolor=3Dgrey</TT> (or some other color) in the cluster.=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q7" name=3DQ7><B>Q7</A>. =
How can I=20
symmetrize (balance) tree layouts?</B>=20
<P>When a tree node has an even number of children, it isn't necessarily =

centered above the two middle ones. If you know the order of the =
children, a=20
simple hack is to introduce new, invisible middle nodes to re-balance =
the=20
layout. The connecting edges should also be invisible. For example: =
<PRE>digraph G {
a -&gt; b0;
xb [label=3D"",width=3D.1,style=3Dinvis]
a -&gt; xb [style=3Dinvis];
a -&gt; b1;
{rank=3Dsame b0 -&gt;  xb -&gt; b1 [style=3Dinvis]}
b0 -&gt; c0;
xc [label=3D"",width=3D.1,style=3Dinvis]
b0 -&gt; xc [style=3Dinvis];
b0 -&gt; c1;
{rank=3Dsame c0 -&gt;  xc -&gt; c1 [style=3Dinvis]}
}
</PRE>This trick really ought to be build into our solver (and made =
independent=20
of the order of the children, and available for layouts other than =
trees, too).=20
<H2>Output features</H2><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q8"=20
name=3DQ8><B>Q8</A>. How can I get high quality (antialiased) =
output?</B>=20
<P>The easiest thing may be to make the layout in Postscript (option=20
<TT>-Tps</TT>), then run through <A=20
href=3D"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostview</A> with antialiasing =
enabled.=20
The important command line options are <TT>-dTextAlphaBits=3D4=20
-dGraphicsAlphaBits=3D4</TT> (4 is the highest level of antialiasing =
allowed - see=20
the <A =
href=3D"http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/GPL/8.15/Use.htm">Ghostview=20
documentation</A>). The full command line to render a raster could be =
something=20
like: <PRE>gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dTextAlphaBits=3D4 =
-dGraphicsAlphaBits=3D4 -sDEVICE=3Dpng16m -sOutputFile=3Dfile.png =
file.ps
</PRE>
<P>On Mac OS X, the <A =
href=3D"http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/">pixelglow</A>=20
port uses Apple's Quartz renderer, which enables antialiasing. It also =
provides=20
a beautiful document container for its user interface. (One downside is =
that you=20
can't run Pixelglow Graphviz as a web server or other background process =
if your=20
Mac has 3D graphics, because Quartz wants to get this resource to =
accelerate=20
rendering. Another problem is that as of this writing, Pixelglow =
Graphviz hasn't=20
been updated in a long time, maybe mid 2004.)=20
<P>On the Linux bleeding edge, Graphviz has an optional plugin to use =
the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.cairographics.org/">cairo</A> back end, which has =
antialiased,=20
path-based graphics. If you want this, you must install cairo, which is =
not part=20
of Graphviz. Cairo can be built from source, and binary RPMs for Fedora =
Core 5=20
(test 2) are available. Then you need to install the optional <A=20
href=3D"http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/CURRENT/">graphviz-cairo</A>=
 plugin.=20
(n.b. we tried cairo-1.0.2-1.fc4.remi for FC4 - it has errors.)=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q9" name=3DQ9><B>Q9</A>. =
I can only=20
get 11x17 output.</B>=20
<P>It's not us! It's probably your printer setup. If you don't believe =
this, run=20
<TT>dot -Tps</TT> and look at the <TT>BoundingBox</TT> header. The =
coords are in=20
1/72ths of an inch.=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q10" =
name=3DQ10><B>Q10</A>. How do I=20
create special symbols and accents in labels?</B>=20
<P>The following solution only works with the raster drivers that load =
Truetype=20
or Type1 fonts! (That means, <TT>-Tgif, -Tpng, -Tjpeg</TT>, and possibly =

<TT>-Tbmp</TT> or <TT>-Txbm</TT> if enabled). Use UTF8 coding, =
<I>e.g.</I>=20
&amp;#165; for the Yen currency symbol =C2=A5. Example: <PRE>      graph =
G {
            yen [label=3D"&amp;#165;"]
      }
</PRE>
<P>You can look up other examples in this handy <A=20
href=3D"http://www.graphviz.org/doc/char.html">character set =
reference</A>.=20
<P><A name=3DQ10b><B>Q. More generally, how do I use non-ASCII character =
sets?</B>=20
</A>
<P>The following applies to Graphviz 2.8 and later. (In older versions =
of=20
Graphviz, you can sometimes get away with simply putting Latin-1 or =
other UTF-8=20
characters in the input stream, but the results are not always correct.) =

<P><B>Input:</B> the general idea is to find the <A=20
href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</A> value for the =
glyph you=20
want, and enter it within a text string "...." or HTML-like label =
&lt;...&gt;.=20
<P>For example, the mathematical <IT>forall</IT> sign (=E2=88=80) has =
the value 0x2200.=20
There are several ways this can be inserted into a file. One is to write =
out the=20
ASCII representation: "&amp;#&lt;nnn&gt;;" where &lt;nnn&gt; is the =
decimal=20
representation of the value. The decimal value of 0x2200 is 8704, so the =

character can be specified as "&amp;#8704;" . Alternatively, Graphviz =
accepts=20
UTF-8 encoded input. In the case of forall, its UTF-8 representation is =
3 bytes=20
whose decimal values are 226 136 128. For convenience, you would =
probably enter=20
this using your favorite editor, tuned to your character set of choice. =
You can=20
then use the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/#TOCdownloading">iconv</A> =
program to=20
map the graph from your character set to UTF-8 or Latin-1.=20
<P>We also accept the HTML symbolic names for Latin-1 characters as =
suggested <A=20
href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q10">above</A>. (Go to=20
http://www.research.att.com/~john/docs/html/index.htm and click on =
Special=20
symbols and Entities) For example, the cent sign (unicode and Latin-1 =
value=20
decimal 162 can be inserted as <PRE>&amp;cent;
</PRE>
<P>Note that <B>the graph file must always be a plain text document</B> =
not a=20
Word or other rich format file. Any characters not enclosed in "..." or=20
&lt;...&gt; must be ordinary ASCII characters. In particular, all of the =
DOT=20
keywords such as <TT>digraph</TT> or <TT>subgraph</TT> must be ASCII.=20
<P>Because we cannot always guess the encoding, you should set the graph =

attribute <TT>charset</TT> to <A=20
href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</A>, <A=20
href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1">Latin1</A> (alias =
ISO-8859-1 or=20
ISO-IR-100) or <A href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-5">Big-5</A> =
for=20
Traditional Chinese. This can be done in the graph file or on the =
command line.=20
For example <TT>charset=3DLatin1</TT>.=20
<P><B>Output:</B> It is essential that a font which has the glyphs for =
your=20
specified characters is available at final rendering time. The choice of =
this=20
font depends on the target code generator. For the gd-based raster =
generators=20
(PNG, GIF, etc.) you need a TrueType or Type-1 font file on the machine =
running=20
the Graphviz program. If Graphviz is built with the <TT>fontconfig</TT> =
library,=20
it will be used to find the specified font. Otherwise, Graphviz will =
look in=20
various default directories for the font. The directories to be searched =
include=20
those specified by the <TT>fontpath</TT> attribute, related environment =
or shell=20
variables (see the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:fontpath">fontpath<=
/A>=20
entry), and known system font directories. The table <A=20
href=3D"http://www.graphviz.org/doc/char.html">http://www.graphviz.org/do=
c/char.html</A>=20
points out that these glyphs are from the <TT>times.ttf</TT> font. With=20
fontconfig, it's hard to specify this font. <TT>Times</TT> usually gets =
resolved=20
to Adobe Type1 times, which doesn't have all the glyphs seen on that =
page.) <!--- can someone explain whether Cairo differs from libgd here? =
--->
<P>For Postscript, the input must be either the ASCII subset of UTF-8 or =

Latin-1. (We have looked for more general solutions, but it appears that =
UTF-8=20
and Unicode are handled differently for every kind of font type in =
Postscript,=20
and we don't have time to hack this case-by-case. If someone wants to =
volunteer=20
to work on this, let us know.)=20
<P>For SVG output, we just pass the raw UTF-8 (or other encoding) =
straight=20
through to the generated code.=20
<P>Non-ASCII characters probably won't ever work in Grappa or dotty, =
which have=20
their own back end rendering. (Though, Java supports UTF-8, so there's a =
chance=20
Grappa also handles raw UTF-8 strings.)=20
<P>As you can see, this is a sad state of affairs. Our plan is to =
eventually=20
migrate Graphviz to the <A href=3D"http://www.pango.org/">pango</A> text =

formatting library, to ameliorate the worst of these complications.=20
<P><A name=3DQ11><B>Q. How do I get font and color changes in record =
labels or=20
other labels?</B> </A>
<P>This is not possible in record shapes. However, you can do this using =
<A=20
href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html">HTML-like =
labels</A>. The=20
granularity of changes is still at the cell level, but by playing with =
cell=20
spacing and padding, you can get pretty much the effect you want. The =
intention=20
is to support arbitrary font changes within running text in the =
not-too-distant=20
future.=20
<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q12" =
name=3DQ12><B>Q12</A>. In plain=20
format, splines do not touch the nodes (arrowheads are missing).</B>=20
<P>Edges are specified as the main spline and, if necessary, arrowheads =
which=20
actually abut the node. If the arrowheads are not given, drawing the =
edge spline=20
will leave a gap between the edge and the node. This is a bug which has =
now=20
solidified into a feature. A workaround is to set <PRE>      edge =
[dir=3Dnone]
</PRE>Since the edges have no arrowheads, the spline specification will =
go all=20

<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q32" =
name=3DQ32><B>Q32</A>. Neato=20
runs forever on a certain example.</B>=20
<P>First, how big is your graph? Neato is a quadratic algorithm, roughly =

equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling. If you feed it a =
graph with=20
thousands of nodes and edges, it can easily take hours or days. The =
first thing=20
to check is to run <TT>neato -v</TT> to get a trace of the output. If =
the=20
numbers you see are generally getting smaller, the layout is just taking =
a long=20
time. You can set certain parameters, such as <TT>epsilon</TT> or=20
<TT>maxiter</TT> to shorten the layout time, at the expense of layout =
quality.=20
But if your graph is big, who's going to notice?=20
<P>If you see the numbers repeating, or fluctuating up and down, then =
neato is=20
cycling, especially if your graph is small. This should never happen by =
default=20
for versions later than 1.13. If it does, please report it as a bug.=20
<P>If you are using an earlier version of neato, or you used =
<TT>mode=3DKK</TT>,=20
cycling is indeed possible. This cycling is very sensitive to the =
initial=20
layout. By using the <TT>start</TT> attribute, for example, <PRE>neato =
-Gstart=3D3
neato -Gstart=3Drand
</PRE>the cycling will most likely disappear. Or you can employ the =
parameters=20
used for large graphs to stop the layout earlier: <PRE>neato =
-Gepsilon=3D.01
neato -Gmaxiter=3D500
</PRE>
<P>Note that, if you have a large graph, the generation of edges as =
splines is a=20
cubic algorithm, so you would do well to avoid using =
<TT>splines=3Dtrue</TT>.=20
(This commment applies to circo, fdp and twopi as well.)=20

label placement in neato is bad.</B>=20
<P>Difficult problem. We're working on it. If anyone has some general =

<P><A href=3D"http://graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q34" =
name=3DQ34><B>Q34</A>. Dot runs=20
forever on a certain example.</B>=20
<P>Try dot -v to observe its progress.=20
<P>Note that it's possible to make graphs whose layout or even parsing =
is=20
quadratic in the input size. For example, in dot, <PRE>digraph G {
    a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; .... -&gt; x -&gt; y -&gt; z
    a -&gt; z
    b -&gt; z
    c -&gt; z
    /* and so on... */
	x -&gt; z
}
</PRE>The total edge length (therefore the layout time) of this as a =
ranked=20
graph is quadratic in the number of nodes. You probably won't encounter =
the=20
following, but it is also possible to construct graphs whose parsing =
takes=20
quadratic time in the number of attributes, by appending attributes to =
nodes and=20
edges after the graph has been loaded. For example: <PRE>digraph G {
    /* really big graph goes here...with N+1 nodes */
    n0 -&gt; n1 -&gt; ... -&gt; nN;

    n0 [attr0=3D"whatever",
        attr1=3D"something else",
    /* and so on with many more attributes */
        attrM=3D"something again"]
}
</PRE>When an attribute first appears, each object is visited with =
possible cost=20
proportional to the number of previously declared attributes. Thus, the =
running=20
time for the above would be <I>cN</I> O(<I>M</I>) for some constant =
<I>c</I>. If=20
there is any concern about this, the graph should specify the attributes =
first=20
before declaring nodes or edges. In practice, this problem is neglible.=20
<P><A name=3DQ34a><B>Q. Twopi runs forever on a certain example.</B> =

<P><A name=3DQ35><B>Q. Neato has unnecessary edge crossings, or has =
missed an=20

<P>Neato and all similar virtual physical model algorithms rely on =
heuristic=20
solutions of optimization problems. The better the solution, the longer =
it takes=20
to find. Unfortunately, it is also possible for these heuristics to get =
stuck in=20
local minima. Also, it is heavily influenced by the initial position of =
the=20
nodes. It is quite possible that if you run neato again, but with a =
different=20

example: <PRE>neato -Gstart=3D5 file.dot -Tps -o file.ps

<P>Then test whether webdot runs from a shell command. (With webdot we =

    invoked from within
"source cgi-bin/webdot

    (file "scaffold.tcl" line 22)
</PRE>The above is a strong clue that webdot is not configured properly. =

<P>Finally, test whether webdot runs as a cgi-bin program. It may help =
to=20
examine the cgi-bin environment using a simple cgi-bin tcl script like: =
<PRE>	#!/bin/env tclsh

<P>Also, if you see something like: <PRE>WebDot Error:

</PRE>This usually means that webdot ran succesfully, but was not able =
to fetch=20
the remote graph from the URL you gave as an argument. The reason is =

that your server is behind a firewall that blocks the webdot server, so =
